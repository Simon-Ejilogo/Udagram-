This project shows hands-on experience on infrastructure as code

I have chosen a realistic scenario where you will deploy a dummy application (a sample JavaScript or HTML file) to the Apache Web Server running on an EC2 instance.

There will be two parts to this project:

a. Diagram: Develop a diagram as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.

b. Script (Template and Parameters): A matching CloudFormation script.
